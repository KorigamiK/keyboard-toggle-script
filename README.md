# Keyboard toggle script
A script to toggle keyboard on and off on ubuntu/debian/linux.

Change `id` variable of `toggle_keyboard.sh` to the keyboard id you get by running `xinput`

Change the path to the icons. `keyboard.png` and `no_keyboard.png` in the `.desktop` file and in `toggle_keyboard.sh`.

Add the `.desktop` file to `~/.local/share/applications/`

It will help you if you are facing trouble getting the keyboard to work for some reason. Like me.
